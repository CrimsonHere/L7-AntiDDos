L7-AntiDDoS
Introduction
Welcome to the L7 AntiDDoS repository! This project is proudly developed by Pc Principal#8752. The L7 AntiDDoS is a robust tool designed to enhance the security of your web applications by mitigating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Background
The development of L7 AntiDDoS started about a month ago with the intention of releasing it after integrating additional features like header verification and advanced support for tools like Turnstile. During its beta phase, it successfully mitigated significant attacks, proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

Features
Basic DDoS Protection: Provides a layer of security against Layer 7 DDoS attacks.
(Upcoming) Header Verification: To ensure enhanced security through rigorous request validation.
(Upcoming) Turnstile Integration: Aiming to incorporate support for Cloudflare's Turnstile, enhancing bot management.
Motivation for Release
In light of a recent incident where an individual tested the beta version and then claimed ownership without providing any substantial improvements, I've decided to release the project publicly. This move ensures the community has access to the genuine and original version of L7 AntiDDoS, maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the work.

Getting Started
To use L7 AntiDDoS, follow these steps:

Setup Node.js Environment: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from Node.js official website.

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the cloned directory and install necessary dependencies:

Copy code
npm install express request-ip
Configure SSL/TLS: Obtain SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS. Place your private key and certificate in a secure directory, and update the file paths in the script:

javascript
Copy code
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('YourPrivateKeyPath', 'utf8');
const certificate = fs.readFileSync('YourCertificatePath', 'utf8');
Run the Server: Start the server by running the script:

Copy code
node yourScriptName.js
After running the script, you should see a message indicating that the HTTPS server is running on port 443.

Adjust Rate Limiting: Modify MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND and MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP in the script as per your requirements to control the request rate and number of connections per IP.

Monitor and Maintain: Regularly monitor the performance and adjust settings as necessary for optimal protection.
